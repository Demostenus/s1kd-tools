s1kd\-flatpm \- Flatten a publication module for publishing
.SH Synopsis
.PP
s1kd\-flatpm [\-Nxp] <PM> [<DM>...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]s1kd\-flatpm\f[] tool combines a publication module and the
data modules it references in to a single file for use with a publishing
system.
.PP
Data modules are searched for in the current directory using the data
module code, language and/or issue info provided in each reference.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-N
Assume that the files representing the referenced data modules do not
include the issue info in their filenames, i.e.
they were created using the \-N option of the s1kd\-new* tools.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-x
Use XInclude rather than copying each data module\[aq]s contents
directly inside the publication module.
DTD entities in data modules will only be carried over to the final
publication when using this option, otherwise they do not carry over
when copying the data module.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-p
Instead of the "flat" PM format, use a "publication" XML format, where
the root element \f[C]publication\f[] contains XInclude references to
the publication module and the referenced data modules.

When using the \-p option, the filenames to include can be specified
manually as additional arguments instead of searching for them in the
current directory.
When not using the \-p option, additional arguments are ignored.
