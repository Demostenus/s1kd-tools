s1kd\-instance \- Create S1000D data/pub module instances
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
s1kd\-instance [\-s <src>] [\-e <ext>] [\-c <dmc>] [\-l <lang>] [\-n
<iss>] [\-I <date>] [\-u <sec>] [\-o <file>|\-O <dir>] [\-f] [\-t
<techName>] [\-i <infoName>] [\-a|\-A] [\-Y <text>] [\-C <comment>] [\-R

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]s1kd\-instance\f[] tool filters a master S1000D data module on
user\-supplied applicability definitions, producing a new data module
instance with non\-applicable elements and (optionally) unused
applicability statements removed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s <src>
The source data module or publication module (default is to read from
stdin).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-e <ext>
Specify an extension on the data module code (DME) or publication module
code (PME) for the instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-c <dmc>
Specify a new data module code (DMC) or publication module code (PMC)
for the instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-l <lang>
Set the language and country of the instance.
For example, to create an instance for US English, lang would be
"en\-US".
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-n <iss>
Set the issue and inwork numbers of the instance.
By default, the issue and inwork number are taken from the source.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-I <date>
Set the issue date of the instance.
By default, the issue date is taken from the source.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-u <sec>
Set the security classification of the instance.
An instance may have a lower security classification than the source if
classified information is removed for a particular customer.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-o <file>
Output instance to file instead of stdout.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-O <dir>
Output instance(s) in dir, automatically naming them based on:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
the extension specified with \-e, and/or
.IP \[bu] 2
the code specified with \-c, and/or
.IP \[bu] 2
the language and country specified with \-L
.PP
The issue information is copied from the source or taken as specified in
the \-I option.
.RE
.TP
.B \-f
Overwrite existing file with same name as the filename generated
automatically with \-O, if it exists.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-t <techName>
Give the instance a different techName/pmTitle.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-i <infoName>
Give the data module instance a different infoName.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-a
Remove unused applicability annotations but not statements.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-A
Remove unused applicability annotations and simplify/remove unused
applicability statements.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-Y <text>
Set the applicability for the whole data module/publication module using
the user\-defined applicability values, using text as the new display
text.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-C <comment>
Add an XML comment to the top of the instance.
Useful as another way of identifying a data module/publication module as
an instance aside from the source address or extended code, or giving
additional information about a particular instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-R <CIR> ...
Use a CIR (Common Information Repository) to resolve external
dependencies in the master data module, making the instance data module
standalone.
Additional CIRs can be used by specifying the \-R option multiple times.
Currently the functional item, warnings/cautions and applicability CIRs
are supported.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-S
Do not include <sourceDmIdent>/<sourcePmIdent>/<repositorySourceDmIdent>
in the instance.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-w
Check the applicability of the whole data module/publication module
against the user\-defined applicability.
If the whole data module/publication module is not applicable, then no
instance is created.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-N
Omit issue/inwork numbers from automatically generated filenames.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-P <PCT>
PCT (Product Cross\-reference Table) file to read product definitions
from (\-p).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-p <id>
Product ID of the product to read applicability definitions from, using
the specified PCT data module (\-P).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-L
Source (\-s or stdin) is a list of data module/publication module
filenames to create instances of, rather than a single data
module/publication module.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B <applic>...
Any number of applicability definitions in the form of:
<ident>:<type>=<value>
.RS
.RE
.SS \-a vs \-A
.PP
The \-a option will remove applicability annotations (applicRefId) from
elements which are deemed to be unambiguously valid (their validity does
not rely on applicability values left undefined by the user).
The applicability statements themselves however will be untouched.
.PP
The \-A option will do the above, but will also attempt to simplify
unused parts of applicability statements or remove unused applicability
statements entirely.
It simplifies a statement by removing <assert> elements determined to be
either unambiguously valid or invalid given the user\-defined values,
and removing unneeded <evaluate> elements when they contain only one
remaining <assert>.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]
.PP
The \-A option may change the \f[I]meaning\f[] of certain applicability
statements without changing the \f[I]display text\f[].
Display text is always left untouched, so using this option may cause
display text to be technically incorrect.
.RE
.SS Identifying source data module of an instance
.PP
The resulting data module instance will contain the element
<sourceDmIdent>, which will contain the identification elements of the
data module specified with the \-s option.
Publication module instances will contain the element <sourcePmIdent>
instead.
.PP
Additionally, the instance will contain an element
<repositorySourceDmIdent> for each CIR specified with the \-R option.
.PP
If the \-S option is used, neither the <sourceDmIdent>/<sourcePmIdent>
elements or <repositorySourceDmIdent> elements are added.
This can be useful when this tool is not used to make an "instance" per
se, but more generally to make a data module based on an existing data
module.
.SS Instance data module code (\-c) vs extension (\-e)
.PP
When creating a data module instance, the instance should have the same
data module code as the master data module, with an added extension
code, the DME.
However, in cases where a vendor does not support this extension or
possibly when this tool is used to create "instances" which will from
that point on be maintained as normal standalone data modules, it may be
desirable or necessary to change the data module code instead.
These two options can be used together as well to give an instance a new
DMC as well an extension.
