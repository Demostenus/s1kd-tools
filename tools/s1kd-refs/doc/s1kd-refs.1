s1kd\-refs \- Manage references between CSDB objects

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]s1kd\-refs\f[] tool lists external references in CSDB objects,
optionally matching them to a filename in the CSDB directory hierarchy.
This makes it easy to obtain a list of dependencies for CSDB objects,
such as ICNs, to ensure they are delivered together, or to check for
references to CSDB objects which do not exist in the current CSDB.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
List all references, both matched and unmatched.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-C, \-D, \-E, \-G, \-P
List references to comments, data modules, external publications, ICNs,
and publication modules respectively.
If none are specified, \-CDEGP is assumed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-c
List references in the \f[C]content\f[] section of a CSDB object only.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-d <dir>
Directory to search for matches to references in.
By default, the current directory is used.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-F
When using the \-U or \-X options, overwrite the input objects that have
been updated or tagged.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-f
Include the filename of the source object where each reference was found
in the output.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-h \-?
Show help/usage message.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-i
Ignore issue and language info when matching references.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-l
Treat input (stdin or arguments) as lists of filenames of CSDB objects
to list references in, rather than CSDB objects themselves.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-N
Assume filenames of referenced CSDB objects omit the issue info, i.e.
they were created with the \-N option to the s1kd\-new* tools.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-n
Include the filename of the source object where each reference was
found, and display the line number where the reference occurs in the
source file after its filename.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode.
Errors are not printed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-R
List references in matched objects recursively.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-r
Search for matches to references in directories recursively.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-s
Include the source object as a reference.
This is helpful when the output of this tool is used to apply some
operation to a source object and all its dependencies together.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-U
Update the address items (such as titles) of matched references from the
corresponding object.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-u
Show only unmatched reference errors, or unmatched codes if combined
with the \-a option.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-X
Tag unmatched references with the processing instruction
\f[C]<?unmatched?>\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP

Output a detailed XML report instead of plain text messages.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show version information.
.RS
.RE
