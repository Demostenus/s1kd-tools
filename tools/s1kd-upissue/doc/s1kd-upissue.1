.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]s1kd\-upissue\f[] tool increases the in\-work or issue number
of an S1000D CSDB object.
.PP
Any files using an S1000D\-esque naming convention, placing the issue
and in\-work numbers after the first underscore (_) character, can also
be "upissued".
Files which do not contain the appropriate S1000D metadata are simply
copied.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-1 <type>
Set first verification type (tabtop, onobject, ttandoo).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-2 <type>
Set second verification type (tabtop, onobject, ttandoo).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-c <reason>
Add a reason for update to the upissued objects.
Multiple RFUs can be added by specifying this option multiple times.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-d
Do not actually create or modify any files, only print the name of the
file that would be created or modified.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-f
Overwrite existing upissued CSDB objects.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-I
Do not change issue date.
Normally, when upissuing to the next inwork or official issue, the issue
date is changed to the current date.
This option will keep the date of the previous inwork or official issue.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-i
Increase the issue number of the CSDB object.
By default, the in\-work issue is increased.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-l
Treat input (stdin or arguments) as lists of CSDB objects to upissue,
rather than CSDB objects themselves.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-N
Omit issue/inwork numbers from filename.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-q
Keep quality assurance information from old issue.
Normally, when upissuing an official CSDB object to the first in\-work
issue, the quality assurance is set back to "unverified".
Specify this option to indicate the upissue will not affect the contents
of the CSDB object, and so does not require it to be re\-verified.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-R
Delete only change markup on elements associated with an RFU (by use of
the attribute \f[C]reasonForUpdateRefIds\f[].
Change markup on other elements is ignored.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-r
Keep old RFUs.
Normally, when upissuing an offical CSDB object to the first in\-work
issue, any reasons for update are deleted automatically, along with any
change markup attributes on elements (when change type is "add" or
"modify") or the elements themselves (when change type is "delete").
This option prevents their deletion.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-s <status>
Set the status of the new issue.
Default is \[aq]changed\[aq].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v
Print the file name of the upissued CSDB object.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show version information.
.RS
.RE
.TP
